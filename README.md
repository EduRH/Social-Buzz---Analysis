# Social-Buzz - Analysis and Visualization -


The Accenture Data Analysis experience "Navigating Numbers" present us with the next scenario: 

---
"Social Buzz" is a social media conglomerate established in 2010. Since its fundation the company has been growing quickly, reaching more than 500 million registered users in the last 5 years Whose create over 100,000 pieces of content everyday in the platform. 

Because of this, the company has sought for external expertise to learn about proper data practices, and receive guidance to develop an IPO.

Accenture has started a 3 month initial project to get into this, were the following points of action are expected: 

- Audit of Social Buzz big data practice
- Implementation of a successful IPO 
- Analysis of the Top 5 most popular Content Categories
---

For this excercise, I developed the third point "Analysis of Top 5 popular Content Categories". 

I started by reviewing the presented databasets, and selecting only the ones useful for the requirements of this excercise. The selected datasets were cleaned and merged using Excel.

After that, I leaded the clenaed dataset into Power BI to find quick insights using the visualization tools present in the program.

By using parameters like "reaction score" and "number of reactions" to sort the categories, I could find insights about the most used media for those categories, the general sentiment, and their development throught time. 

I analyzed the other categories as well, using the same parameters to find related insights. 

The insights found during this analysis were showcased on a PowerPoint presentation, and their visuals were integrated on a Power BI Dashboard. Both present in this repository
